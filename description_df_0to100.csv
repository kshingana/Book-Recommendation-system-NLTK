It's a time when the growing threat of fascism in Europe is a constant worry, and people escape from reality through radio and the movies. Meanwhile, the two sisters -- vastly different in personality, yet inextricably linked by a shared past -- try to find their places within the complex web of social expectations for young women in the 1930s. While Nora embarks on a glamorous career as a radio-soap opera star, Clara, a strong and independent-minded woman, struggles to observe the traditional boundaries of a small and tight-knit community without relinquishing her dreams of love, freedom, and adventure. However, things aren't as simple as they appear -- Nora's letters eventually reveal life in the big city is less exotic than it seems, and the tranquil solitude of Clara's life is shattered by a series of unforeseeable events. These twists of fate require all of Clara's courage and strength, and finally put the seemingly unbreakable bond between the sisters to the test."

In addition to the dispute over dormant accounts, Swiss banks provided to the Nazi war machine the foreign currency that paid for vital war materiel such as chrome and aluminum. The author also explains how the exposure of the myth of Swiss neutrality, in collaboration with the Nazis, triggered investigations into the role of the British regarding Holocaust victims and the part played by Germany and its failure to compensate the survivors of slave labor, as well as the upheaval in the art world, which failed to restore stolen paintings to their rightful owners."

Su autora, que firma con el seudónimo de Irene González Frei , acogiéndose a las bases del premio, ha decidido mantener el anonimato. El fallo del jurado, por primera vez en la historia de este premio, fue unánime. Y no es para menos, ya que nos encontramos ante una primera novela que no sólo introduce a sus lectores en una hermosa y densa fantasía erótica, sino que les revela a una auténtica escritora. Irene González Frei dedica su novela a Marina , «de todos los personajes de esta historia el único cuyo nombre no he tenido el valor de cambiar», y cede la palabra a Sofía para que sea ella la que nos cuente, desde el recuerdo, «ese amor vertiginoso entre las grietas del dolor y el desconsuelo» que las unirá para siempre y fundirá sus cuerpos, más allá del tenue cristal de los espejos, en el reflejo de Narciso. Sofía , una joven al parecer como tantas otras, vive en Madrid en el seno de un grupo de amigos que comparten inquietudes y amores. Tras el matrimonio con Santiago, cuyas relaciones sexuales se extreman en la violencia a medida que el tiempo va corroyendo el afecto y las apetencias, Sofía , desencantada y triste, encuentra un día a Marina . Entre las dos se establece instantáneamente una atracción singular, casi mágica. Emprenden un viaje por Italia con destino a Roma, donde a Marina le espera un trabajo en una organización internacional. Poco a poco, de manera irresistible, el lector irá impregnándose de la progresiva compenetración de las dos mujeres, de la gradual fusión de sus cuerpos hasta el punto de que ya no parecen sino una sola. Visiones, sueños, episodios premonitorios van, sin embargo, recordándole que Marina sólo vive ya en la memoria de Sofía y que una amenaza se cierne sobre ellas. . . La crudeza con que Irene González Frei nos sumerge en los distintos encuentros sexuales no sólo de las dos mujeres, sino los de ellas con otros personajes, que sirven de contrapunto, invitando al lector a participar directamente de sus tensiones y violencias, de sus goces y delirios, no merma en momento alguno el tono poético que envuelve toda la novela y que le otorga la inestimable facultad de dejar una huella indeleble en quienes la leen."

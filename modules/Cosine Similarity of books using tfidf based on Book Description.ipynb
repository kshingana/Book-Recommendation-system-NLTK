It's a time when the growing threat of fascism in Europe is a constant worry, and people escape from reality through radio and the movies. Meanwhile, the two sisters -- vastly different in personality, yet inextricably linked by a shared past -- try to find their places within the complex web of social expectations for young women in the 1930s. While Nora embarks on a glamorous career as a radio-soap opera star, Clara, a strong and independent-minded woman, struggles to observe the traditional boundaries of a small and tight-knit community without relinquishing her dreams of love, freedom, and adventure. However, things aren't as simple as they appear -- Nora's letters eventually reveal life in the big city is less exotic than it seems, and the tranquil solitude of Clara's life is shattered by a series of unforeseeable events. These twists of fate require all of Clara's courage and strength, and finally put the seemingly unbreakable bond between the sisters to the test.\",\n",

In this updated edition, readers discover how and why the Swiss finally buckled and agreed to pay $1.25 billion in compensation for the funds deposited by Holocaust victims in Swiss banks. In addition to the dispute over dormant accounts, Swiss banks provided to the Nazi war machine the foreign currency that paid for vital war materiel such as chrome and aluminum. The author also explains how the exposure of the myth of Swiss neutrality, in collaboration with the Nazis, triggered investigations into the role of the British regarding Holocaust victims and the part played by Germany and its failure to compensate the survivors of slave labor, as well as the upheaval in the art world, which failed to restore stolen paintings to their rightful owners.\",\n",
